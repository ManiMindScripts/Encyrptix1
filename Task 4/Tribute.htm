                <h2>MOHSIN-E-PAKISTAN</h2>
                <p> <b>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan </b>, often referred to as the "father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb," played
                    a pivotal
                    role in transforming Pakistan into a nuclear-armed state. Born on April 1, 1936, in Bhopal, India,
                    Khan moved to Pakistan after the partition in 1947. He pursued advanced studies in metallurgy and
                    nuclear engineering in Europe, earning a doctorate from the Catholic University of Leuven in
                    Belgium. Upon returning to Pakistan in the mid-1970s, Khan established the Kahuta Research
                    Laboratories (now Khan Research Laboratories), where he spearheaded the development of uranium
                    enrichment technology. This breakthrough enabled Pakistan to conduct its first successful nuclear
                    tests in 1998, solidifying its status as a nuclear power. While hailed as a national hero in
                    Pakistan for his contributions to the country’s security, Khan's legacy is also marred by
                    controversy due to his involvement in nuclear proliferation activities, including allegations of
                    sharing nuclear technology with Iran, North Korea, and Libya. Despite these controversies, Dr. A.Q.
                    Khan remains a highly influential and complex figure in the history of global nuclear proliferation
                    and Pakistan's national defense. He passed away on October 10, 2021, leaving behind a legacy that
                    continues to evoke both admiration and debate.</p>
